# Module 04 Challenge: Web APIs Quiz
This week's challenge is a quiz using JavaScript fundamentals.  As a full-stack web developer, a coding assessment will probably be asked to take as part of an interview process so I am using this week's challenge to display my javascript skills.  This quiz will give me the opportunity to apply the skills from this module.  I will be creating a time coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. It will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.
